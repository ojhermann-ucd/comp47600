I did a case insensitive seach for what I thought would be a large result on both sides: sex_VERB,sex_NOUN.  sex_NOUN has many results, whereas sex_VERB has only one.  I find this odd as even non-salacious books commonly use the verb sex.  But even more importatly, the 1933 paper by Masui and Hashimoto was widely cited (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS716US716&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=15753894102812554802), and subsequent work continues in sexing chickens.  Perhaps there is a naive morality filter in the Google Ngram Viewer.

But no, because fuck_noun and fuck_verb are well documented; it seems that sex_VERB does not occur enough.
