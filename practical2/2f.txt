I did a case insensitive seach for what I thought would be a large result on both sides: sex_VERB,sex_NOUN.  sex_NOUN has many results, whereas sex_VERB has only one.  I find this odd as even non-salacious books commonly use the verb sex.  It certainly occurs more than once in Catch-22, Catcher in the Rye, and other widely read and cited novels.  Perhaps there is some prude filter that needs to be reset on on the Google Ngram Viewer.
