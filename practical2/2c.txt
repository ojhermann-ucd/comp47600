I chose the phrase "credit crunch" and suspected wider adoption of the phrase would have commenced in 2007/2008, when the term was widely employed in popular media; however, it seems that the term was commonly employed as early as 1961, in Feder Banking Law  Service, Volume 37 (https://books.google.ie/books?id=2GI9AQAAIAAJ&q=%22%22credit+crunch%22%22&dq=%22%22credit+crunch%22%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqsJqy4tLWAhXBVhoKHVD-C64Q6AEINTAD).  Also of interest is that the phrase was relatively more frequenlty used in the late 1970's and early 1980s, during the US Savings and Loan Crisis, than it was during the more recent banking fiascos (note, however, that the Google NGram Viewer cuts on in 2008 and most of the canonical work on the credit issues of the late 2000's were published from 2009 onwards).
