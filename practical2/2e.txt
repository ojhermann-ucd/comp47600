I seached for "idiot", "moron", and "boner" as they are synonyms referring unkindly to a simpleton.  I rean my search from 1950 until the final data in 2008.  I'm not surprised by the dominance of "idiot", as it has more uses and definitions than the other two terms, but I am surprised that from 1955 onwards the shape of the graphs for each of the three phrases is closely and consistently positivley correlated.  As their relative frequencies are also fairly constant, I find it rather interesting that the three words have maintained a similar volume of use over time.

I would speculate that these three phrases exibit this behaviour for myriads reasons, but principally that "moron" is a type of "idiot", and "boner" is a type of "moron", while they're non-related uses are randomly in their textual appearance e.g. "boner" refering to tumecense.
