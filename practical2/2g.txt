I chose "equality", "suffrage", and "liberation" as they all related to widepsread rise of democratic government and individual rights that have been on the rise, on average, for the past 500 years.

Equality is the most frequently used, but all follow a similar trend until 1936, when "liberation" shoots up for 40 years, before declining just as rapidly until the end of the data set.  The peaks of the words correspond to democratic movements e.g. "suffrage" around 1915, when the suffragette movement built up in the US, gaining women the vote in 1920.  The abrupt spike relating to "liberation" between the 1930s and 1970s relates to myriad movements that identified with specific oppressed groups: womemens liberations, black liberation, various anti-colonial movements, etc.

The apparent return to the mean values and high levels of correlation might be explained by the relative degrees of generality of the three words: "equality" is a term used across disciplines and concepts, "liberation" tends to relate to specific, finite movements, and "suffrage" is a more specific concept relating to a particular activity and associated rights.
