It appears that the excluded words are stop words.  Reviewing the documentation for the R wordcloud package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud/wordcloud.pdf) confirms this is the case: our input translates is a character vector and, when we did not specify the freq parameter in our command, standard stopwords were removed prior to plotting the word cloud.
