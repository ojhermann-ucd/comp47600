This document contains some mad shit, yo.  I'll trying to mix slang form the '00s a.k.a. the 2000's aka the naughties, as well as some archaic terms.  I once worked a bogus gig at RBC Capital Markets . . . it was not the place for me.  Here's a funny joke: what's better than a rose on a piano?  Tulips on an organ.

I think this document is approaching the intentional length, but maybe I'll add some T.S. Eliot to fuck with it.  No grammar ever!!!!!!!!  Or yes, some grammar.

Today I took delivery of a bean bag, which, as a phrase, also means scrotum.  Fucking amazing the myriad uses of individual phrases in English.  It must drive the non-native speakers bonkers.  Or perhaps it makes them feel better about their native tounges.  See?  That was a terrible use of language.

I wonder if the abbreviation of International Business Machines is IBM or I.B.M.?  I'll be it's IBM as that looks slicker on a business card.

I cannot recommend the student highly enough.  I think that is my favourite (favorite?) ambiguous phrase.
